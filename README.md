# authentication_secrets
This is the project related to authentication and security.

First, trying to obtain new register of username and password.

Second, level up database security, trying to encrypt data in database using mongoose-encryption package.

Third, adding dotenv package to use the environment variables to secure sensitive-information.

Fourth,replacing mongoose-encryption by bcrypt (Hashing and Salting).

Fifth, Using passport.js to add cookies and sessions.

Finally, at the end of project, I used OAuth to make website more secure and more convenience.


***PS. I replaced md5 instead before using of bcrypt.***
